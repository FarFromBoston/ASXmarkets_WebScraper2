# ASXmarkets_WebScraper2

IN PYTHON

Please read the README.txt It will show you the couple of lines to change for your own PC


# WHAT IT DOES

This will go to the site https://www.listcorp.com/asx/sectors/materials Which has a table of hundreds of rows of ASX companies (matierals companies)

Using selenium, the table will be taken and stripped into lists. A CSV will be read in and from the website, the MARKET CAP and acronym of the ASX listed company will be read in the marketCap value for each market will be added as a new row in the CSV with the date the program ran.

Simply run the program. To add more markets just add their names in the CSV as per the existing columns.

# USE THIS FOR

to record the MarketCap for ASX listed companies (as many as you want) forever. If you want, convert the .py file into an exe and have it run on pc startup.
